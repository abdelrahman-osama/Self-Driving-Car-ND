# Self-Driving-Car-ND

This repository contains my projects and submissions for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program
which I started working on since 15 December 2017.

The Self-Driving Car Engineer is an online certification intended to prepare students to become 
self-driving car engineers. The program was developed by Udacity in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, 
NVIDIA, Otto, DiDi, BMW, McLaren and NextEv.
